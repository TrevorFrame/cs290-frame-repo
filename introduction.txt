Hello, my name is Trevor Frame.

I currently reside in Fresno, California. I am married and 2 fur babies. 

I have worked in banking for over 5 years now in various roles. I worked in the online and mobile banking 
department for a credit union where I was able to learn some HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Microsoft SQL. 

I hope to someday work in cyber security or artificial intelligence.

I'm very excited about this class!
